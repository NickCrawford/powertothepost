  [The survival of the US Postal Service should not be political!!! I have already noticed extreme delays and even the removal of my closest mailbox! I absolutely rely on the USPS for the survival of my Etsy shop, as I know many others do as well. Please!

  - Proposed changes without petitions and change:

  The Postal Service will implement a hiring freeze, according to the reorganization announcement, and will ask for voluntary early retirements. It also will realign into three ‚Äúoperating units‚Äù ‚Äî retail and delivery, logistics and processing, and commerce and business solutions ‚Äî and scale down from seven regions to four.

- **Voting Issues with the Post**

  What's happening to sorting machines:

  [I just posted an article about this from the Washington post on my Twitter. @AGirlHasNoPres It's a really informative read about what they're doing with the post office boxes, post offices and sorting machines. The third slide is showing where they are moving these boxes, in comparison to where Hillary won in 2016. They are also highly populated areas, which tend to go for Democrats. If you're not on Twitter, Google the headline in the last slide](https://www.instagram.com/p/CD9VKe-H7MF/)

  "The Postal Service also is poised to remove 671 mail-sorting machines, roughly 10 percent of its inventory, in the coming month, another move election advocates say could slow down voters‚Äô access to ballots and other important election information." ‚Äî [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/14/people-are-freaking-out-about-mailbox-removals-postal-service-says-its-routine/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/14/people-are-freaking-out-about-mailbox-removals-postal-service-says-its-routine/)
